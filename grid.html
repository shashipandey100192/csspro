            <p>ow-fidelity wireframes: These are the most basic and are typically rough sketches or simple digital mock-ups focused on the overall structure, layout, and functionality of a page or app. They lack detailed design elements like colors, fonts, and images, often using placeholders or grayscale to represent content. They are ideal for early-stage brainstorming, rapid iteration, and gaining feedback on the core concepts before diving into visual design.</p>

            <p>Mid-fidelity wireframes: These are more detailed than low-fidelity wireframes and incorporate more realistic content, basic icons, and grid systems for alignment and spacing. They can also include some level of interactivity, like clickable buttons and links, to better represent the user experience.
High-fidelity wireframes: These are the most detailed and closely resemble the final design, including specific fonts, colors, imagery, and interactive elements. High-fidelity wireframes can often be made interactive and used for usability testing and refining the design before moving into full development. </p>
